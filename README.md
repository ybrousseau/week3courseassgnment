# week3courseassgnment

In this project, data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was retrieved, worked with, and cleaned, to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This repository contains the following files:
README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
tidy_data.txt, which contains the data set.
CodeBook.md, the code book, which describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data).
run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set (see the Creating the data set section below)

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
* Load the activity and feature info
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

This script requires the dplyr package
